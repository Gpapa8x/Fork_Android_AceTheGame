## Ace The Game

**Ace The Game** is the first open-source hacking tool designed for manipulating the memory of Android applications enabling users to change and freeze memory values. This tool also has an interesting feature which enables users to bypass payment methods seamlessly. Notably, this tool boasts compatibility with both rooted and non-rooted Android devices.


**Features Include:**

- Memory scanner and editor for Android and Linux platform
  
  This feature  enables users to effortlessly manipulate various in-app memories like coins, items, and health through graphical interface. Additionally, it provides advanced capabilities for crafting hacks such as fly (by freezing y value) or teleportation.
  
- Non rooted support for android application
  
  This support utilizes an ingenious method to bypass root requirements. By patching the apk, it integrates a memory scanning/editing library directly into the app itself. Subsequently, a function triggers a service that scans and modifies application's own memory, eliminating the need for root access.

- Bypassing In-App Purchases (**BETA** version)
  
  bypassing in-app purchases by patching the APK, rerouting purchase requests to our dedicated APK (Billing-Hack), thereby granting users access to premium features without financial constraints.
